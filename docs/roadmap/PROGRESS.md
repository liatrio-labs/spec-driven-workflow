- ‚úÖ Cataloged existing research files:
  - `code-analyst.md` - WHAT/HOW from code
  - `information-analyst.md` - WHY from documentation
  - `context_bootstrap.md` - Manager orchestration pattern

#### 2. Renamed Prompt ‚úÖ

- ‚úÖ Renamed `reverse-engineer-codebase` ‚Üí `generate-context`
  - Better reflects purpose: generating context for development
  - Aligns with workflow terminology
  - Shorter, more concise name

#### 3. Enhanced `generate-context` Prompt ‚úÖ

**File:** `prompts/generate-context.md`
**Lines:** 877 lines (up from ~500)
**Status:** Complete and ready for use

**Major Enhancements:**

##### Evidence Citation Standards ‚úÖ

- **For Code:** `path/to/file.ts:45-67` with line ranges
- **For Docs:** `path/to/doc.md#section-heading` with timestamps
- **For User Input:** `[User confirmed: YYYY-MM-DD]` with direct quotes
- **Example:** "Authentication uses JWT (src/auth/jwt.ts:23-45)"

##### Confidence Assessment ‚úÖ

Every finding must be categorized:

- üü¢ **High Confidence:** Strong evidence from working code or explicit docs
- üü° **Medium Confidence:** Inferred, behind feature flags, or implied
- üî¥ **Low Confidence:** Cannot determine, conflicts, or unknowns

Explicitly flags items needing user validation.

##### Separation of Concerns ‚úÖ

- **WHAT/HOW:** Discovered from code analysis (stay in lane, don't infer WHY)
- **WHY:** Extracted from documentation (rationale, decisions, trade-offs)
- **Intent/Goals:** Provided by user (fills gaps, resolves conflicts)

##### Phased Analysis Process ‚úÖ

1. **Repository Structure Analysis** - Auto-detect layout, tech stack
2. **Documentation Audit** - Scan, inventory, extract rationale, flag gaps
3. **Code Analysis (WHAT + HOW)** - Features, workflows, architecture, patterns
4. **Integration Points** - External services, dependencies, events
5. **Gap Identification** - Missing rationale, conflicts, unknowns
6. **User Collaboration** - Short focused questions (3-5 max), not batch
7. **Generate Analysis** - Complete evidence-based document

##### Interactive Questioning ‚úÖ

- **OLD:** Long batch questionnaires
- **NEW:** Short rounds (3-5 questions max), wait for answers, ask follow-ups
- Captures user answers as direct quotes for later citation

##### Execution Path Tracing ‚úÖ

Step-by-step flow examples:

```text
User Login Flow:
1. POST /api/auth/login ‚Üí src/api/routes/auth.ts:23
2. AuthController.login() ‚Üí src/controllers/AuthController.ts:45
3. AuthService.validateCredentials() ‚Üí src/services/AuthService.ts:67
...
```

##### Essential Files List ‚úÖ

- 5-10 priority files with specific line ranges
- **Example:** `src/services/UserService.ts:45-234` - Core user management logic

##### Comprehensive Example Output ‚úÖ

- Full 13-section document structure with real examples
- Shows proper evidence citations, confidence emojis, execution traces
- Includes gap documentation, open questions, next steps

##### Quality Checklist ‚úÖ

Pre-completion verification:

- [ ] All code findings have file:line citations
- [ ] All doc findings have path#heading references
- [ ] User answers captured as quotes with dates
- [ ] Confidence levels marked
- [ ] Essential files list complete (5-10 files)
- [ ] At least 2 execution path traces
- [ ] Gaps/unknowns explicitly documented

##### Key Principles Embedded ‚úÖ

1. Evidence-based (every claim needs proof)
2. Confidence levels (distinguish fact from inference)
3. Stay in lane (don't guess WHY from code)
4. Flag gaps explicitly (better "Unknown" than guessing)
5. Interactive not batch (short questions)
6. Actionable outputs (specific files, traces, recommendations)

## Phase 2: Future Improvements (Next PR)

The following improvements are **documented and ready to implement** but will be handled in a separate branch/PR to keep this PR focused and reviewable.

### Priority 1: Critical Workflow Enhancements

#### A. Enhance `generate-spec` with Mandatory Clarifying Phase

**File:** `prompts/generate-spec.md`
**Status:** Planned for next PR
**Estimated Effort:** Medium (2-3 hours)

**Changes Needed:**

1. **Add Phase 2A: Context Review (NEW)**
   - Prerequisite: Must have run `generate-context`
   - Read analysis document
   - Review essential files identified
   - Understand existing patterns

2. **Add Phase 3: Clarifying Questions ‚≠ê CRITICAL (ENHANCED)**
   - **Make it MANDATORY STOP POINT**
   - Add WHY questions:
     - What problem does this solve?
     - Why build this now? (strategic fit)
     - What's the business value?
     - How will we measure success?
   - Phase questions into rounds:
     - Round 1: Core requirements (3-5 questions)
     - **‚õî STOP - Wait for answers**
     - Round 2: Context & constraints (based on Round 1 answers)
     - **‚õî STOP - Wait for answers**
     - Round 3: Refinement (fill remaining gaps)
     - **‚õî STOP - Wait for final confirmation**
   - Capture all answers as direct quotes with dates
   - Reference codebase context document explicitly

3. **Update Spec Structure**
   - Add "Context & Rationale" section (WHY)
   - Include evidence citations when referencing existing code
   - Reference decisions from codebase context analysis

**Impact:** Prevents building wrong features by ensuring all requirements are clear before design begins.

**Research Source:** Claude Code Phase 3 + information-analyst.md patterns

---

#### B. Create `generate-architecture-options` Prompt (NEW)

**File:** `prompts/generate-architecture-options.md`
**Status:** Planned for next PR
**Estimated Effort:** High (4-5 hours)

**Purpose:** Generate 2-3 architectural approaches with trade-off analysis before task generation

**Process:**

1. **Prerequisites Check:**
   - Spec document exists
   - Codebase context analysis exists
   - User has approved spec

2. **Review Context:**
   - Read spec document
   - Read codebase context analysis
   - Review essential files identified

3. **Generate 3 Approaches:**
   - **Minimal Changes:** Smallest change, maximum code reuse, fastest to ship
   - **Clean Architecture:** Best maintainability, elegant abstractions, most extensible
   - **Pragmatic Balance:** Balanced trade-off between speed and quality

4. **For Each Approach:**
   - **Patterns & Conventions Found:** With file:line references
   - **Architecture Decision:** Clear choice with rationale
   - **Component Design:** Files, responsibilities, dependencies, interfaces
   - **Implementation Map:** Specific files to create/modify with details
   - **Data Flow:** Entry ‚Üí transformations ‚Üí output
   - **Build Sequence:** Phased checklist
   - **Trade-offs:** Pros and cons explicitly stated
   - **Critical Details:** Error handling, state, testing, performance, security

5. **Present to User:**
   - Brief summary of each approach
   - Trade-offs comparison table
   - **AI recommendation with reasoning** (based on codebase context)
   - Concrete implementation differences

6. **‚õî STOP - User must choose approach**

7. **Save Choice:**
   - Save chosen approach to `/tasks/architecture-[spec-number].md`
   - Document rationale for choice (for future ADR)

**Output Example:**

```markdown
# Architecture Options: User Profile Editing (Spec 0001)

## Approach 1: Minimal Changes
**Summary:** Extend existing UserService, add new endpoint to existing routes
**Pros:**
- Fast (2-3 days)
- Low risk (minimal code changes)
- Uses familiar patterns
**Cons:**
- Couples new feature to existing code
- Harder to test in isolation
- May not scale if requirements expand

## Approach 2: Clean Architecture
**Summary:** New ProfileService with dedicated interface, separate routes
**Pros:**
- Clean separation of concerns
- Easy to test and extend
- Sets good pattern for future features
**Cons:**
- More files (slower initial development)
- Requires refactoring some existing code
- Team needs to learn new pattern

## Approach 3: Pragmatic Balance (RECOMMENDED)
**Summary:** New ProfileService integrated into existing structure
**Pros:**
- Good boundaries without excessive refactoring
- Testable and maintainable
- Fits existing architecture patterns
**Cons:**
- Some coupling remains to UserService

**Recommendation:** Approach 3 - Based on codebase context analysis showing layered architecture with service boundaries, this approach provides clean separation while avoiding extensive refactoring. Aligns with existing patterns in `src/services/PaymentService.ts:34-178`.

**Which approach do you prefer?**
```

**Impact:** Enables better architectural decisions by presenting options with explicit trade-offs rather than single solution.

**Research Source:** Claude Code code-architect agent + Phase 4
