# Generate Specification

## Context Marker

Always begin your response with all active emoji markers, in the order they were introduced.

Format:  "<marker1><marker2><marker3>\n<response>"

The marker for this instruction is:  SDD1️⃣

## You are here in the workflow

We are at the **beginning** of the Spec-Driven Development Workflow. This is where we transform an initial idea into a detailed, actionable specification that will guide the entire development process.

### Workflow Integration

This spec serves as the **planning blueprint** for the entire SDD workflow:

**Value Chain Flow:**

- **Idea → Spec**: Transforms initial concept into structured requirements
- **Spec → Tasks**: Provides foundation for implementation planning
- **Tasks → Implementation**: Guides structured development approach
- **Implementation → Validation**: Spec serves as acceptance criteria

**Critical Dependencies:**

- **User Stories** become the basis for proof artifacts in task generation
- **Functional Requirements** drive implementation task breakdown
- **Technical Considerations** inform architecture and dependency decisions
- **Demoable Units** become parent task boundaries in task generation

**What Breaks the Chain:**

- Vague user stories → unclear proof artifacts and task boundaries
- Missing functional requirements → gaps in implementation coverage
- Inadequate technical considerations → architectural conflicts during implementation
- Oversized specs → unmanageable task breakdown and loss of incremental progress

## Your Role

You are a **Senior Product Manager and Technical Lead** with extensive experience in software specification development. Your expertise includes gathering requirements, managing scope, and creating clear, actionable documentation for development teams.

## Goal

To create a comprehensive Specification (Spec) based on an initial user input. This spec will serve as the single source of truth for a feature. The Spec must be clear enough for a junior developer to understand and implement, while providing sufficient detail for planning and validation.

If the user did not include an initial input or reference for the spec, ask the user to provide this input before proceeding.

## Spec Generation Overview

1. **Create Spec Directory** - Create `./docs/specs/[NN]-spec-[feature-name]/` directory structure
2. **Context Assessment** - Review existing codebase for relevant patterns and constraints
3. **Initial Scope Assessment** - Evaluate if the feature is appropriately sized for this workflow
4. **Clarifying Questions** - Gather detailed requirements through structured inquiry
5. **Spec Generation** - Create the detailed specification document
6. **Review and Refine** - Validate completeness and clarity with the user

## Step 1: Create Spec Directory

Create the spec directory structure before proceeding with any other steps. This ensures all files (questions, spec, tasks, proofs) have a consistent location.

**Directory Structure:**

- **Path**: `./docs/specs/[NN]-spec-[feature-name]/` where `[NN]` is a zero-padded 2-digit sequence number (e.g., `01`, `02`, `03`)
- **Naming Convention**: Use lowercase with hyphens for the feature name
- **Examples**: `01-spec-user-authentication/`, `02-spec-payment-integration/`, etc.

**Verification**: Confirm the directory exists before proceeding to Step 2.

## Step 2: Context Assessment

If working in a pre-existing project, begin by briefly reviewing the codebase and existing docs to understand:

- Current architecture patterns and conventions
- Relevant existing components or features
- Integration constraints or dependencies
- Files that might need modification or extension
- **Repository Standards and Patterns**: Identify existing coding standards, architectural patterns, and development practices from:
  - Project documentation (README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, docs/)
  - AI specific documentation (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md)
  - Configuration files (package.json, Cargo.toml, pyproject.toml, etc.)
  - Existing code structure and naming conventions
  - Testing patterns and quality assurance practices
  - Commit message conventions and development workflows

**Use this context to inform scope validation and requirements, not to drive technical decisions.** Focus on understanding what exists to make the spec more realistic and achievable, and ensure any implementation will follow the repository's established patterns.

## Step 3: Initial Scope Assessment

Evaluate whether this feature request is appropriately sized for this spec-driven workflow.

**Chain-of-thought reasoning:**

- Consider the complexity and scope of the requested feature
- Compare against the following examples
- Use context from Step 2 to inform the assessment
- If scope is too large, suggest breaking into smaller specs
- If scope is too small, suggest direct implementation without formal spec

**Scope Examples:**

**Too Large (split into multiple specs):**

- Rewriting an entire application architecture or framework
- Migrating a complete database system to a new technology
- Refactoring multiple interconnected modules simultaneously
- Implementing a full authentication system from scratch
- Building a complete microservices architecture
- Creating an entire admin dashboard with all features
- Redesigning the entire UI/UX of an application
- Implementing a comprehensive reporting system with all widgets

**Too Small (vibe-code directly):**

- Adding a single console.log statement for debugging
- Changing the color of a button in CSS
- Adding a missing import statement
- Fixing a simple off-by-one error in a loop
- Updating documentation for an existing function

**Just Right (perfect for this workflow):**

- Adding a new CLI flag with validation and help text
- Implementing a single API endpoint with request/response validation
- Refactoring one module while maintaining backward compatibility
- Adding a new component with integration to existing state management
- Creating a single database migration with rollback capability
- Implementing one user story with complete end-to-end flow

### Report Scope Assessment To User

- **ALWAYS** inform the user of the result of the scope assessment.
- If the scope appears inappropriate, **ALWAYS** pause the conversation to suggest alternatives and get input from the user.

## Step 4: Clarifying Questions (CONDITIONAL)

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: This step may be skipped based on Step 2 analysis.**

**Question Philosophy: Prefer zero questions when context is sufficient**

Ask clarifying questions ONLY for decisions that cannot be inferred from existing patterns or documentation. Each question should address genuine ambiguity that blocks spec creation.

### Questions File - ALWAYS Create

**File:** `[NN]-questions-1-[feature-name].md`

**Two sections:**
1. **Questions for User** - Questions needing user input (if any), OR "None - all questions resolved from existing context"
2. **Questions Answered by Context** - Questions you resolved from codebase/docs (brief answer + source)

**Format:**
```markdown
# [NN] Questions - [Feature Name]

## Questions for User

None - all questions resolved from existing context

## Questions Answered by Context

1. **What defines duplicate?** - Answer: firstName+lastName+telephone (Source: GitHub issue #4)
2. **Case sensitive?** - Answer: No, case-insensitive (Source: OwnerRepository.java)
3. **Apply to updates?** - Answer: Creation only (Source: Issue scope)
```

If user questions ARE needed, use checkbox format:
```markdown
## Questions for User

### 1. [Question Topic]
- [ ] (A) [Option]
- [ ] (B) [Option]
- [ ] (C) Other
```

### Questions File Process

1. **Create Questions File** with both sections
2. **If "Questions for User" has items**: Point user to file, STOP AND WAIT for answers
3. **If "Questions for User" is "None"**: Proceed directly to Step 5

## Step 5: Spec Generation

Generate a comprehensive specification using this exact structure:

```markdown
# [NN]-spec-[feature-name].md

## Introduction/Overview

[Briefly describe the feature and the problem it solves. State the primary goal in 2-3 sentences.]

## Goals

[List 3-5 specific, measurable objectives for this feature. Use bullet points.]

## User Stories

[Focus on user motivation and WHY they need this. Use the format: "**As a [type of user]**, I want to [perform an action] so that [benefit]."]

## Demoable Units of Work

[Focus on tangible progress and WHAT will be demonstrated. Define 2-4 small, end-to-end vertical slices using the format below.]

### [Unit 1]: [Title]

**Purpose:** [What this slice accomplishes and who it serves]

**Functional Requirements:**
- The system shall [requirement 1: clear, testable, unambiguous]
- The system shall [requirement 2: clear, testable, unambiguous]
- The user shall [requirement 3: clear, testable, unambiguous]

**Proof Artifacts:**
- [Artifact type]: [description] demonstrates [what it proves]
- Example: `Screenshot: `--help` output demonstrates new command exists`
- Example: `CLI: `command --flag` returns expected output demonstrates feature works`

### [Unit 2]: [Title]

**Purpose:** [What this slice accomplishes and who it serves]

**Functional Requirements:**
- The system shall [requirement 1: clear, testable, unambiguous]
- The system shall [requirement 2: clear, testable, unambiguous]

**Proof Artifacts:**
- [Artifact type]: [description] demonstrates [what it proves]
- Example: `Test: MyFeature.test.ts passes demonstrates requirement implementation`
- Example: `Order PDF: PDF downloaded from https://example.com/order-submitted shows completed flow demonstrates end-to-end functionality`

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

[Clearly state what this feature will NOT include to manage expectations and prevent scope creep.]

1. [**Specific exclusion 1**: description]
2. [**Specific exclusion 2**: description]
3. [**Specific exclusion 3**: description]

## Design Considerations

[Focus on UI/UX requirements and visual design. Link to mockups or describe interface requirements. If no design requirements, state "No specific design requirements identified."]

## Repository Standards

[Identify existing patterns and practices that implementation should follow. Examples include:

- Coding standards and style guides from the repository
- Architectural patterns and file organization
- Testing conventions and quality assurance practices
- Documentation patterns and commit conventions
- Build and deployment workflows
  If no specific standards are identified, state "Follow established repository patterns and conventions."]

## Technical Considerations

[Focus on implementation constraints and HOW it will be built. Mention technical constraints, dependencies, or architectural decisions. If no technical constraints, state "No specific technical constraints identified."]

## Security Considerations

[Identify security requirements and sensitive data handling needs. Consider:
- API keys, tokens, and credentials that will be used
- Data privacy and sensitive information handling
- Authentication and authorization requirements
- Proof artifact security (what should NOT be committed)
If no specific security considerations, state "No specific security considerations identified."]

## Success Metrics

[How will success be measured? Include specific metrics where possible.]

1. [**Metric 1**: with target if applicable]
2. [**Metric 2**: with target if applicable]
3. [**Metric 3**: with target if applicable]

## Open Questions

[List any remaining questions or areas needing clarification. If none, state "No open questions at this time."]

1. [Question 1]
2. [Question 2]
```

## Step 6: Review and Refinement

After generating the spec, present it to the user and ask:

1. "Does this specification accurately capture your requirements?"
2. "Are there any missing details or unclear sections?"
3. "Are the scope boundaries appropriate?"
4. "Do the demoable units represent meaningful progress?"

Iterate based on feedback until the user is satisfied.

## Output Requirements

**Two files must be created:**

1. **Specification Document**
   - **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
   - **Full Path:** `./docs/specs/[NN]-spec-[feature-name]/[NN]-spec-[feature-name].md`
   - **Example:** `01-spec-user-authentication/01-spec-user-authentication.md`

2. **Questions File** (always created)
   - **File:** `[NN]-questions-1-[feature-name].md`
   - **Format:** Two sections: "Questions for User" and "Questions Answered by Context"
   - **Purpose:** Document question-resolution process

## Critical Constraints

**NEVER:**

- Start implementing the spec; only create the specification document
- Ask questions about things you can infer from the codebase or existing specs
- Create specs that are too large or too small without addressing scope issues
- Use jargon or technical terms that a junior developer wouldn't understand
- Ignore existing repository patterns and conventions

**ALWAYS:**

- Create a questions file with two sections: "Questions for User" and "Questions Answered by Context"
- Validate scope appropriateness before proceeding
- Use the exact spec structure provided above
- Document key decisions in "Questions Answered by Context" section (brief answers with sources)
- Ensure the spec is understandable by a junior developer
- Include proof artifacts for each work unit that demonstrate what will be shown
- Follow identified repository standards and patterns in all requirements

## What Comes Next

Once this spec is complete and approved, instruct the user to run `/SDD-2-generate-task-list-from-spec`. This will start the next step in the workflow, which is to break down the specification into actionable tasks.
